# FinalProject---MongoDB
Mongo DB - Final project 47/2

After Cloning the repository:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal on the target computer.

2. Navigate to the directory where the project's .csproj file is located. This file contains information about the project and its dependencies.

3. Run the following command to restore the NuGet packages:
   dotnet restore
4. Once the packages are restored, you can then build the project using the following command:
   dotnet build

This command will compile the project and ensure that all the necessary dependencies are available.

After running these commands, the project should be ready to run on the target computer, with the NuGet dependencies installed. 
Make sure that any additional dependencies beyond NuGet packages (such as third-party libraries) are also present on the target computer or included in the project.

Using the dotnet restore and dotnet build commands provides a convenient way to install dependencies without having to copy the entire solution folder from the source computer.
